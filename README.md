Is investing in an Airbnb a viable business venture? To answer this critical question, I have just completed a full project in Tableau that dives deep into the Airbnb rental dataset.
I developed a suite of interactive dashboards to transform raw data into actionable business insights. The core of this project focuses on:
Pricing Strategy: Analyzing the average price per bedroom to understand market standards.
Geographic Profitability: Mapping price variations by zip code to identify high-value neighborhoods.
Revenue Forecasting: Calculating potential annual revenue to assess the financial viability of new listings.
The result is a powerful tool that helps potential investors move from data to decision, clarifying whether to invest, where to invest, and what the potential return on investment could be.
## Tools Used
* Tableau Desktop
## Data Source
This project utilizes the [Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains comprehensive information on Airbnb listings from 2016.
The Tableau workbook (`AirBnB Full Project.twbx` file) used to create this visualization is available in this repository. Feel free to download it to explore the dashboard's construction and design.
